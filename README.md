## Troubleshooting

### Static Files Not Loading When Serving

Follow these steps if static files are not loading properly when serving your site:

1. **Check Developer Tools:**
   - Open developer tools by pressing `F12`.
   - Inspect whether the static files are being directed to the correct path.  
     Example paths you should see:

     ```html
     src="http://127.0.0.1:4000/..."
     src="http://localhost:4000/..."
     src="https://jaehho.github.io/..."
     ```

2. **If Routing to `http://0.0.0.0:4000/...`:**
   - Try the following steps to resolve the issue:

     ```bash
     jekyll clean   # Remove generated files
     jekyll build   # Rebuild the site
     jekyll serve   # Serve the site
     ```
